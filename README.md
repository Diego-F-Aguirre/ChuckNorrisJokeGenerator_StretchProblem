Part 1. 

- Review the following api:
https://api.chucknorris.io

- Have your app dispense a magical random Chuck Norris joke upon hitting the Chuck Me button

- Knowing this information read through the api again and test out the base url and review the json to figure out how you're going to tackle getting the information.


Black Diamond

- The JokeViewController has two vertical stack views with the second containing the JokeTextView. Add a UIImage to the second stack view so you have an image on the top and an the JokeTextView on the bottom.

- Review the following api:
 https://api.imgflip.com

- Make a second api call to generate a meme upon clicking the ChuckMe button. 
  
** Hint ** 

Unlike the Chuck Norris api that gives you back one string for the joke the imgflip api will give you back a whole array of random meme url's... How can you randomly get just one meme out of an array?
